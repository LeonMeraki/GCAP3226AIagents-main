# GCAP3226 — Team Project Overview (Summaries)

This document summarizes each team's project focus, objectives, data needs, methods, and expected outputs based on the README files.

## Team 1 — Flu Shot Campaign Analysis
- Focus: Flu vaccination coverage, campaign effectiveness, and policy optimization in Hong Kong.
- Objectives: Analyze uptake patterns; identify drivers of participation; evaluate interventions; recommend improvements.
- Data: Department of Health vaccination records; Census demographics; public health surveys; healthcare facility data.
- Methods: Regression (uptake vs. demographics/access); Simulation (policy scenarios, resource allocation).
- Outputs: Analysis report, policy recommendations, slides, optional dashboard.

## Team 2 — Bus Route Coordination
- Focus: Optimize bus route coordination and scheduling via demand modeling and simulation.
- Objectives: Predict demand; improve coordination; reduce wait times; balance frequency vs. cost.
- Data: Octopus transactions; GPS bus tracking; weather/events; demographics; Route 56 simulation materials.
- Methods: Regression (demand, travel time); Simulation (multi-route coordination, frequency optimization).
- Outputs: Demand models, coordination algorithms, simulation framework extension, transport policy recommendations, interactive demo.
- Expected Impact: 15–25% lower wait time; 10–20% better utilization (targets).

## Team 3 — Typhoon Preparedness & Emergency Management
- Focus: Evaluate preparedness and emergency response; develop risk prediction.
- Objectives: Analyze historical impacts; assess response effectiveness; propose policy improvements.
- Data: HKO typhoon records; emergency services response; damage assessments; infrastructure and population data; social vulnerability indicators.
- Methods: Regression (impact, risk factors); Simulation (evacuation, resource allocation); timing analysis.
- Outputs: Historical analysis, risk models, policy assessment, preparedness recommendations, interactive risk mapping.

## Team 4 — Municipal Solid Waste Charging
- Focus: Assess MSW charging policy effectiveness and pricing strategies.
- Objectives: Analyze waste patterns and charging impacts; evaluate compliance; model pricing elasticity; optimize implementation.
- Data: Waste collection; charging implementation records; household demographics/economics; facility data; comparative policies.
- Methods: Regression (impact and elasticity); Simulation (behavior, revenue/cost scenarios).
- Outputs: Waste analysis, effectiveness assessment, pricing recommendations, implementation guide, policy simulation tool.

## Team 5 — Green @ Community Initiatives
- Focus: Evaluate community environmental programs and optimize engagement.
- Objectives: Identify success factors; model engagement; improve policy implementation.
- Data: Program data; environmental monitoring; participation records; demographics/socioeconomics; policy records.
- Methods: Regression (effectiveness, engagement drivers); Simulation (participation scenarios, resources).
- Outputs: Effectiveness analysis, engagement model, allocation recommendations, policy strategies, impact dashboard.

## Team 6 — Bus Stop Merge & Optimization
- Focus: Optimize bus stop placement and merging strategies with accessibility preserved.
- Objectives: Identify merge candidates; assess walking distance/accessibility; recommend implementation.
- Data: Bus stop locations; ridership by stop; OD patterns; urban planning/demographics; accessibility standards.
- Methods: Spatial analysis (GIS, catchments, walking distance); Optimization (multi-objective: efficiency vs. accessibility).
- Outputs: Current-state report, merge framework, impact assessment, implementation roadmap, interactive map.

## Cross-cutting notes
- Common methods: regression + simulation; some projects add spatial analysis (Teams 3 & 6).
- Data dependencies: multiple government sources (HKO, DH, HA, EDB, C&SD, transport data); potential CAI requests.
- Deliverables converge on: analysis report, policy recommendations, and interactive artifacts (dashboards/maps/sim tools).
