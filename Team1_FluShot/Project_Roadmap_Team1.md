**Team Focus:** Analysis of flu vaccination campaigns and public health policy effectiveness in Hong Kong
**Supervisors:** Dr. Talia Wu (Mathematics), Dr. Simon Wang (English)
**Final Deliverable:** 2,500-3,000 word group research report
**Current Status:** Week 5 - Project Scoping & Planning

## Core Research Question
**Primary Question:** To what extent does the Hong Kong government use data-driven approaches in flu vaccination campaign planning and resource allocation?

**Specific Focus Areas:**
- Vaccination coverage patterns across demographics
- Campaign effectiveness and resource allocation
- Policy intervention impact assessment
- Predictive modeling for future campaigns

## Detailed Project Timeline (Weeks 5-13)

### Phase 1: Planning & Initial Data Collection (Weeks 5-7)

#### Week 5: Project Scoping & Planning (Current Week)
**Tasks:**
- Finalize research question and scope
- Assign team roles (see Section 3)
- Draft enquiry email to Department of Health under Code on Access to Information
- Begin literature review on flu vaccination policies

**Government Enquiry Template:**
> **Subject:** Request for Information under the Code on Access to Information: Flu Vaccination Campaign Data Analysis
> 
> **To:** Access to Information Officer, Department of Health
> 
> **Dear Access to Information Officer,**
> 
> We are undergraduate students from Hong Kong Baptist University enrolled in GCAP3226: Data-Driven Government. As part of our final project, we are studying the decision-making processes related to flu vaccination campaign planning and resource allocation.
> 
> Under the principles of the Code on Access to Information, we would be grateful if you could provide us with the following information:
> 
> 1. What specific quantitative data points (e.g., demographic vaccination rates, campaign effectiveness metrics, resource allocation data) were used to inform the planning of the 2023-2024 flu vaccination campaign?
> 2. Could you provide any public reports or policy documents that outline the standard operating procedures for determining vaccination site locations and resource allocation?
> 3. What data-driven criteria are used to evaluate the success of flu vaccination campaigns and inform future planning?

**Deliverable:** Submit one-page project plan and draft enquiry email to supervisors for feedback.

#### Week 6: Fieldwork & Primary Data Request (No Class)
**Tasks:**
- Send approved enquiry email to Department of Health
- Begin intensive secondary data collection
- Conduct fieldwork at vaccination centers (with permission)
- Search for government annual reports, press releases, and data on data.gov.hk

**Actionable Instructions:**
- Search for flu vaccination data on data.gov.hk
- Collect demographic data from Census and Statistics Department
- Review Department of Health annual reports and press releases
- Create shared document to log all sources

**Deliverable:** Copy of sent email with timestamp and preliminary bibliography of at least 10 secondary sources.

#### Week 7: Data Consolidation & Model Selection
**Tasks:**
- Organize all collected secondary data
- Review any response from Department of Health
- Decide on mathematical model (Regression or Simulation)

**Model Choice Justification:**
- **Choose Regression** if focusing on predicting vaccination rates based on demographic factors, campaign timing, or resource allocation
- **Choose Simulation** if modeling complex vaccination campaign scenarios, resource allocation optimization, or population behavior under different policy interventions

**Deliverable:** One-paragraph justification for model choice, submitted to Dr. Wu for approval.

### Phase 2: Modelling & Analysis (Weeks 8-10)

#### Weeks 8-9: Building "The Ideal" Scenario
**Tasks:**
- Develop mathematical model for optimal vaccination campaign planning
- Clean dataset and run model
- Document assumptions, variables, and methodology

**Regression Model Approach:**
- **Dependent Variable:** Vaccination rates by district/demographic group
- **Independent Variables:** Age distribution, income levels, accessibility to vaccination sites, campaign timing, resource allocation
- **Analysis:** Identify key factors affecting vaccination uptake

**Simulation Model Approach:**
- **System Definition:** Hong Kong vaccination campaign infrastructure
- **Variables:** Population demographics, vaccination site capacity, campaign duration, resource constraints
- **Scenarios:** Different resource allocation strategies, campaign timing options, target population prioritization

**Deliverable:** Preliminary model results and draft methodology section.

#### Week 10: Synthesizing Reality & Ideal
**Tasks:**
- Compare current government vaccination campaign practices with model results
- Identify gaps between current approach and data-driven optimization
- Analyze potential consequences of current limitations

**Deliverable:** Bullet-point summary of comparative analysis.

### Phase 3: Reporting & Finalization (Weeks 11-13)

#### Week 11: Drafting Recommendations & Report Writing
**Tasks:**
- Formulate 3-5 concrete, evidence-based recommendations
- Each team member writes assigned section (~500 words each)
- Ensure recommendations address identified gaps

**Sample Recommendations:**
1. "Implement regression-based demand forecasting using demographic and seasonal data to optimize vaccination site placement and resource allocation"
2. "Develop simulation models to test different campaign timing strategies and resource allocation scenarios before implementation"
3. "Establish data-driven criteria for evaluating campaign effectiveness and adjusting future strategies"

**Deliverable:** Complete first draft of entire group report.

#### Week 12: Peer Review, Editing & Consolidation
**Tasks:**
- Edit entire report for consistency, clarity, and tone
- Check grammar, citations, and formatting
- Ensure cohesive narrative flow

**Deliverable:** Near-final version of report, ready for final proofread.

#### Week 13: Final Submission
**Tasks:**
- Final proofread and submission
- Prepare presentation materials

**Deliverable:** 2,500-3,000 word group research report.

## Group Collaboration Framework

### Team Roles (5-6 members)
- **Project Manager:** Tracks deadlines, schedules meetings, main contact with supervisors
- **Lead Researcher - Primary Data:** Manages government enquiry process and correspondence
