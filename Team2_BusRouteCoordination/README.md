# Team 2: Bus Route Coordination

## Project Overview
Optimization of public transportation routes and coordination in Hong Kong using mathematical models and simulation.

## Team Members
- [ ] Add team member names here

## Project Objectives
1. Develop predictive models for passenger demand
2. Optimize bus route coordination and scheduling
3. Improve passenger experience and operational efficiency
4. Create simulation models for testing scenarios

## Current Materials
- `GCAP3226-Topic1-BusFrequency.md` - Bus frequency analysis
- `Topic3_BusRoutesCoordination_MathModels.md` - Comprehensive mathematical modeling approach

## Key Research Questions
- How can regression analysis improve demand prediction?
- What coordination strategies minimize passenger wait times?
- How do external factors (weather, events) affect ridership?
- What is the optimal balance between service frequency and cost?

## Data Sources
- [ ] Octopus card transaction data
- [ ] GPS bus tracking data
- [ ] Weather and event data
- [ ] Population and demographic data
- [ ] Route 56 simulation data (available in course materials)

## Methodology
### Regression Analysis
- Passenger demand prediction models
- Travel time estimation
- Bus utilization forecasting

### Simulation Models
- Multi-route coordination simulation
- Service frequency optimization
- Dynamic scheduling scenarios
- Transfer efficiency modeling

## Technical Framework
Based on existing Route 56 simulation:
- Poisson distribution for passenger arrivals
- Binomial distribution for alighting behavior
- Real-time tracking and queue management
- Performance metrics (wait time, utilization, reliability)

## Deliverables
- [ ] Demand prediction models
- [ ] Route coordination algorithms
- [ ] Simulation framework extension
- [ ] Policy recommendations for transport authorities
- [ ] Interactive demonstration

## Timeline
- [ ] Week 1-2: Literature review and data analysis
- [ ] Week 3-4: Regression model development
- [ ] Week 5-6: Simulation model enhancement
- [ ] Week 7-8: Integration and testing
- [ ] Week 9-10: Report and presentation

## Expected Outcomes
- 15-25% reduction in passenger wait time
- 10-20% improvement in bus utilization
- Enhanced coordination algorithms for real-world application
