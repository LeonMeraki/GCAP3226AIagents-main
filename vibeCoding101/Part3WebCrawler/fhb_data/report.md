## Analysis

{}


## Reflection on Ethical Considerations

- Identified ourselves via a clear User-Agent.

- Applied at least 1s delay; would increase if server load or crawl-delay specified.

- Limited to 20 pages and at most 2 file downloads per page.

- Focused on publicly accessible content and avoided personal data.

- Preferred sitemaps and conservative filtering; would stop if errors or signs of rate limiting occur.
