# Reflective Essay 2 – Government Data Access

Drafting the enquiry made me see how access rules shape what I can actually analyze. Hong Kong offers plenty of open data on data.gov.hk, but the detailed health numbers are often buried in PDFs or only available by request under the Code on Access to Information. That pushed me to spell out exactly which tables I need and why they matter for the policy question.

My biggest lesson was to be specific. I narrowed a vague ask into a concrete list: monthly admissions and A&E attendances, bed occupancy by specialty, and weekly notifiable diseases. Using a polite, professional tone, stating the academic purpose, and acknowledging privacy limits made the request more reasonable. The Part 3 crawl also helped: when I couldn’t find sitemaps for FHB, I took it as a signal to switch to targeted requests and crawl gently.

The AI helped me structure the letter, check completeness, and polish the tone; I brought the project context and chose the indicators. It felt like real policy work: tools speed things up, but judgment stays with me. Whatever the response, I have a plan B with data.gov.hk, CHP bulletins, and HA reports. This experience made me more confident about contacting government and designing analysis around the data I can realistically get.
