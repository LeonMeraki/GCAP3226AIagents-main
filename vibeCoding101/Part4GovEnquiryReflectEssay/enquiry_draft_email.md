Subject: Academic Request for Public Health Statistics (GCAP 3226)

Dear Health Bureau,

I am a student at Hong Kong Baptist University (GCAP 3226: Empowering Citizens through Data). For an academic policy analysis project, may I request access to the following aggregated datasets, if available?

1) Hospital activity (2019–2025 YTD)
   - Monthly admissions and discharges by Hospital Authority cluster
   - A&E attendances by triage category (monthly)
   - Bed occupancy rate by major specialty (daily average or monthly)

2) Disease surveillance
   - Weekly notifiable infectious disease counts by disease category (2019–2025)
   - Outbreak/cluster summaries (if compiled for public release)

3) Healthcare coverage and capacity
   - Public hospital staffed beds by specialty and cluster (annual)
   - Healthcare manpower headcount (doctors, nurses, AHP) by year (public sector)

Preferred format: CSV/Excel; PDF acceptable if machine-readable data are not available. Aggregated data only; no personal information requested.

Purpose: Academic research to analyze utilization patterns, seasonal trends, and capacity, informing evidence-based public health recommendations.

Reference: Code on Access to Information.

Timeline: A response within 4–6 weeks would be appreciated. Interim links or public tables are also helpful.
