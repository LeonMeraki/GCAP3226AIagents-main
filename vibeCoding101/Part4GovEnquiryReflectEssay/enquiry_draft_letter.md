Subject: Request for Public Health Statistics for Academic Research (GCAP 3226)

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a student at Hong Kong Baptist University enrolled in GCAP 3226: Empowering Citizens through Data. For an academic policy analysis project, I respectfully request access to the following aggregated datasets, if available:

1) Hospital activity (2019–2025 YTD)
   - Monthly admissions and discharges by Hospital Authority cluster
   - A&E attendances by triage category (monthly)
   - Bed occupancy rate by major specialty (daily average or monthly)

2) Disease surveillance
   - Weekly notifiable infectious disease counts by disease category (2019–2025)
   - Outbreak/cluster summaries (if compiled for public release)

3) Healthcare coverage and capacity
   - Public hospital staffed beds by specialty and cluster (annual)
   - Healthcare manpower headcount (doctors, nurses, AHP) by year (public sector)

Preferred format: CSV or Excel; PDF reports acceptable if machine-readable data are not available. Aggregated data are sufficient; no personal or identifiable information is requested.

Purpose: The data will be used solely for educational research to analyze service utilization, seasonal patterns, and system capacity, and to develop evidence-based recommendations for public health planning.

Code on Access to Information: This request is made under the spirit of the Code to promote transparency and public access to government information in the public interest.

Timeline: I would be grateful for a response within 4–6 weeks. If preparation requires more time, any interim publicly available tables or links would be appreciated.
