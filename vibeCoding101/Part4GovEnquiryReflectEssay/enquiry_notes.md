# Enquiry Notes (Health Bureau / Public Health Data)

## Project context
- Course: GCAP 3226 (Empowering Citizens through Data)
- Focus: Healthcare statistics, disease surveillance, hospital capacity
- Upstream inputs: Part 3 crawling found limited sitemaps for FHB; requires targeted link seeding and formal enquiries.

## Why this data
- Quantify service utilization and capacity stress (admissions, A&E, beds)
- Monitor disease trends seasonally and across outbreaks
- Support evidence-based recommendations for surge planning and resource allocation

## Known public sources (to cross-check)
- data.gov.hk datasets (HA and CHP related)
- CHP weekly reports / surveillance bulletins (PDF)
- HA annual reports and statistics

## If request is denied or delayed
- Use alternative public sources (data.gov.hk, CHP bulletins, HA reports)
- Narrow scope to proxies (e.g., A&E daily attendance tables if available)
- Triangulate with academic publications and press releases
- Document the gap and recommend publishing aggregate tables

## Follow-up plan
- Wait ~3 weeks, then send polite reminder
- Ask if partial/older aggregated tables can be shared first
- Request guidance on where similar data has been published

## Additional questions to prepare
- Are there data dictionaries/metadata for table fields?
- What is the update frequency and typical lag?
- Are machine-readable formats available or only PDF?
- Are historical series consistent across system changes?
